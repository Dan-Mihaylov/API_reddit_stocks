# Display Most Talked About Stocks In WSB Subreddit Using Tradestie API


#### This is a Tkinter program, working with two separate API's to get information:
* 1st for the most talked about stocks on the WSB subreddit
* 2nd to get some of the companys information depending on their ticker.

#### The stock information you get with the second API (financialmodelingprep) are: 
* Current Stock Price 
* Company Market Cap
* 52w Price Range
* General Info.


#### Things I learned doing this project.
- [x] Basic operations with API's
- [x] Working with json response from requests library
- [x] Creating Json dumps and working with information from dumps
- [x] Organising the code in different modules
- [x] Creating and working with class objects instances
- [x] Styling tkinter window to look more modern

### Improvements to be made:
- [ ] Format the prices to the second decimal
- [ ] Include option to check information from previous dates
- [ ] Maybe change the second API, because the key has only 200 request per day (can use yfinance library)
